# Tinance UI project

We have a legacy system using java/jsp that needs converting and extending using React/jsx as a single web page UI

In the legacy folder, we have the working code to present the application as a single javascript module and a Jsp page with supporting dom elements.

We have a simple menu with a set of functions, including login - which should be replaced by React router

The first task is to get this project working as a React SWP given the legacy code as the example. Completion is defined when we can 'npm start' the 'tinance-ui' folder and it will run the same way as the legacy example.

We also have JWT REST architecture inplace, so developing authentication and calls with JWT would be needed. 

```
git clone (this repository)
```
and open your browser at the legacy file

```
TinanceUI\legacy\main.html
```
